# macos-setup

## Basics

1. Start by creating an admin account on a clean system install, not the actual day-to-day user account<sup>[1]</sup>. Create the personal account once the admin account is set up. ClamAV, etc. should run on startup and be accessible on the user account, and said processes are meant *not* to be changed from any non-admin accounts.
2. Install base stuffs
   1. Iterm2/LibreWolf<sup>[2]</sup>
   2. Macports<sup>[3]</sup>
   3. Fish shell through port<sup>[4]</sup>

  [2] LibreWolf has an ARM-based version. The website download link defaults to the x86-64 version. You can use Alacritty, Kitty, or any terminal emulator you prefer.<br/>
  [3] This guide prefers Macports over Homebrew, see https://saagarjha.com/blog/2019/04/26/thoughts-on-macos-package-managers/<br/>
  [4] Installing packages through port allows updates and a better dependency tree (e.g., if one of fish or some ports package has an update, new dependencies used by either won't break the other's, and this applies to packages beyond fish)

## ClamAV 


1. Start by installing the `clamav-server` port (insert post-installation image): https://ports.macports.org/port/clamav-server/
   - Make sure the settings/permissions are properly given (e.g., full-disk access to daemons) + comment out the Example lines
   - Do not install the ClamAV pkg file, which installs to `/usr/local/` (will hence conflict with the `clamav-server` port, which will always install the `clamav` package on Macports as a dependency)
   - ClamAV on Mac alone does **not** provide background utilities (in contrast to something like `clamav-daemon` on Debian)
2. Settings to validate:
   - DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net â€” enabled (freshclam.conf)
   - Uncomment: LocalSocket /tmp/clamd.socket (clamd.conf)
   - Remark: these should be automatically configured in clamav-server, but it doesn't hurt to double-check

3. Create a launchd file for automatic updates (in case the previous ones don't work):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
      <key>Label</key>
      <string>com.personal.freshclam</string>
      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/local/bin/freshclam</string>
      <string>-d</string>
    </array>
      <key>KeepAlive</key>
      <false/>
      <key>RunAtLoad</key>
      <true/>
      <key>StartInterval</key>
          <integer>43200</integer>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

Check if this loads:
```bash
> sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.personal.freshclam.plist
> sudo launchctl list | grep com.personal.freshclam
> ls -l /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
```

Daily scans script (https://paulrbts.github.io/blog/software/2017/08/18/clamav/):
```bash
> vi ~/scripts/ClamAV

SCAN_DIR="/Users"
LOG_FILE="/opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam-user.log"
echo `date +%F-%H%M` >> $LOG_FILE
/opt/local/bin/clamscan -i -r --move=/Users/admin/quarantine $SCAN_DIR >> $LOG_FILE
```

*Remark: make sure that the clamscan directory is correct, and that the Users/admin/quarantine directory is already created (script may not have access to create folders). Use a separate log file (because this isn't clamav's default log, but one we wrote ourselves) and chown it. Lastly, load the scan script:*

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.personal.clamscan</string>
    <key>Program</key>
    <string>/Users/admin/Scripts/clamscan</string>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <false/>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <false/>
    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
    <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>18</integer>
        <key>Minute</key>
        <integer>28</integer>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/var/log/clamscan.stderr</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Run the /Users/admin/Scripts/clamav script to give it all the permission it needs (on the first run).

**Backup: fix log file permission errors**
```bash
> sudo pkill freshclam
> sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/var/log/clamav
> sudo chown -R _clamav:_clamav /opt/local/var/log/clamav
> sudo chmod 755 /opt/local/var/log/clamav
> sudo touch /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
> sudo chown _clamav:_clamav /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
> sudo chmod 644 /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log
> sudo vi /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.clamav.permissions.plist
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.clamav.permissions</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/bin/sh</string>
        <string>-c</string>
        <string>mkdir -p /opt/local/var/log/clamav; chown -R _clamav:_clamav /opt/local/var/log/clamav; chmod 755 /opt/local/var/log/clamav; touch /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log; chown _clamav:_clamav /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log; chmod 644 /opt/local/var/log/clamav/freshclam.log</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

```bash
> sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.clamav.permissions.plist 
> sudo chmod 644/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.clamav.permissions.plist
> sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.clamav.permissions.plist
```

*Once again, clamd needs to be separately configured from freshclam in order to run it at startup/as a service (https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Installing/Packages.html#macports)
There should be no need to touch/chmod 600/chown clamav /var/log/freshclam.log (or rather, /opt/local/var/log/clamav/clamav.log)*
